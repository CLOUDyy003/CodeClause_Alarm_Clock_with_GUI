# CodeClause_Alarm_Clock_with_GUI
We'll use the Tkinter library, which is a built-in library for creating GUI applications in Python.

The code will open a GUI window with a label, an entry field, and a button. 
Follow these steps to set an alarm:

1. Run the Python script (alarm_clock.py).
2. The GUI window will appear.
3. Enter the desired alarm time in the format HH:MM:SS AM/PM into the entry field (e.g., 07:30:00 AM).
4. Click the "Set Alarm" button.
5. The program will calculate the time difference between the current time and the alarm time and wait for that duration.
6. Once the alarm time is reached, a message box with the text "Wake up!" will be displayed.
7. Additionally, the specified sound file (e.g., sound.wav) will be played.
